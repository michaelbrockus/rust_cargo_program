// USE CASE:
//
// The use case of this file is to contain the test cases needed by this
// project since its important to test once implementation against a set
// of common test cases
//
extern crate program;

// These are tests! Rust has testing built-in so you get a streamlined experience that encourages
// you to write tests more often.
// To run these tests, run `cargo test`
// More information: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch11-00-testing.html

// #[cfg(test)] tells the compiler to only include the rest of this code if we are running
// `cargo test`. This speeds up compile times since Rust doesn't need to process a bunch of code
// which won't be run otherwise.
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    //TODO: Writing more tests. These are not even close to
    // exhaustive, but they are a good start!
