Targeted audience we are building for is Windows 10, MacOSX and Linux users. This project uses
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) `1.48.0` and newer.

## Compile, Test and Install

Firstly the users should compile a project before installing like so:

```console
cargo build
```

The next step should be to test the target to make sure it works:

```console
cargo test
```

Then we install the application like so:

```console
cargo install
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
prog
```
